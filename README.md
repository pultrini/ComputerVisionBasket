# Computer Vision Study: Basketball Segmentation with Python, Roboflow & YOLO

This project is part of a programming studies series focused on Computer Vision techniques, with a practical application in basketball segmentation. The segmentation task leverages Python as the programming language, Roboflow for dataset management and preprocessing, and YOLO (You Only Look Once) as the state-of-the-art object detection model.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build and experiment with a computer vision model that can effectively segment and detect basketballs in video frames or still images. The project is organized into several stages: dataset acquisition and preparation, model training with YOLO, and finally, performance evaluation and experimentation.
This project is made to help a studies of statistical in a games without infrastructure, to better individual improvements.

**Key components:**
- **Python**: The main programming language used for scripting and building the application.
- **Roboflow**: For dataset management, annotation, and preprocessing. This service simplifies the handling of image data and augments images as needed.
- **YOLO**: The deep learning model implemented for object detection and segmentation tasks. YOLO's fast inference speed makes it ideal for real-time applications.

## Features

- **Real-time Segmentation:** Implement segmentation for basketball detection on video streams.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Automated pipeline for preparing image datasets with Roboflow.
- **Custom Model Training:** Fine-tuning YOLO for the basketball segmentation task.
- **Evaluation & Visualization:** Tools and scripts to visualize predictions and compute performance metrics.

## Architecture

The system is divided into the following main components:
- **Data Pipeline:** Uses Roboflow API to download, process, and augment the dataset.
- **Model Training:** A Python script that utilizes YOLO architecture. This part includes:
  - Configuration files for YOLO model settings.
  - Script to launch training and monitor metrics.
- **Inference & Visualization:** A module to run inference on test images and display segmentation masks overlaid on original images or video frames.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**
- **pip package manager**
- Recommended IDE: Visual Studio Code, or anything if you like to use.

You will also need to install the following Python libraries:
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- PyTorch (if using YOLO implementations that depend on it)
- Roboflow (via `roboflow` Python package)
- Additional libraries such as `matplotlib` for visualization
